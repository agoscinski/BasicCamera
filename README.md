# BasicCamera
This Android project is an example for a framework using the android.hardware.camera package.
The framework offers the possibility to capture images with the camera or take preview frames,
to then process the image in its own thread, to finally draw them on the camera surface.
As example for an process I use a Canny edge detector.

# Dependencies
To run the project the OpenCV library for Android is required. Instruction is going to be released.
